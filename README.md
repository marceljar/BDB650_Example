# Fake News Detection

In this project, we aim at creating a basic Fake News detection system.

Our system can take, as an input, text copied from social media, such as Tweeter, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. After processing, a label will be attached to the text deeming it either REAL or FALSE.

We will use a machine learning model, written in Python using **scikit-learn**. Other libraries such as **pandas** and **NumPy** will also be used for data processing. As for data sources, a **News.csv** file, posted at Kaggle will be used to train our system.
